		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a Graphic Design High School teacher, living in Queens, New York. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because after teaching for seven years in design, I realized simply the knowledge of print, marketing, and design, was not enough. At this time, technology is constantly advancing, and as a person working with technology closely with my students, I want to be knowledgeable of all the aspects of the design, including web design and coding, which seems to be the most intimidating and confusing topic of discussion. In order to teach the topic perfectly, I chose to better myself and take this course.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>	
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web developer or website designer for an educational institution or the department of education, creating applications and websites for student help, test review, classwork, access to grades etc., I enjoy an environment where I can help students succeed and become responsible for their own grades. I feel that with the aid of an application or website I create, I can have a visually pleasing website for students and teachers to access where they can receive aid in any topic while following up on their grades.</font></p>
