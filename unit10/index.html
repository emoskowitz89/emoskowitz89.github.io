<h1>Step 1: Design Your Email</h1>
<p>On both my mobile and desktop version of my site, I will have a contact page, where potential clients can input their name, email, their approximate budget for the job they want done, options to upload images related to the project or suggestions of designs, next they will have an option to choose what type of service they are interested in inquiring about including a variety of different jobs ranging from logos, to yearbook design. Lastly, the users have to opportunity to enter any additional comments about their goals for the particular job they are inquiring about. Finally, there is a submit button that sends the information directly to my email. The color scheme will match my responsive website. The hero image used is my logo. This image is placed in the description portion of the email table.</p>
